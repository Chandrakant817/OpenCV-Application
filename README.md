# Computer Vision Overview

Computer Vision is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras, videos, and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects — and then react to what they “see”.

### Key Concepts
1. Image Processing: Techniques for enhancing and transforming images, such as filtering, edge detection, and noise reduction.
2. Object Detection: Identifying and locating objects within an image. Popular models include YOLO (You Only Look Once) and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector).
3. Image Classification: Categorizing images into predefined classes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used for this purpose.
4. Semantic Segmentation: Assigning a class label to each pixel in an image, thus understanding the image at a pixel level.
5. Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, but it differentiates between instances of the same class.

### Applications
1. Autonomous Vehicles: Enabling cars to understand their environment and navigate safely.
2. Healthcare: Assisting in medical diagnostics by analyzing medical images, such as MRIs and X-rays.
3. Security: Enhancing surveillance systems through facial recognition and anomaly detection.
4. Retail: Improving customer experiences with automated checkouts and personalized advertisements.

### Tools and Libraries
1. OpenCV: An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.
2. TensorFlow: An end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning, with extensive support for building and deploying computer vision models.
3. PyTorch: An open-source machine learning library widely used for computer vision tasks, known for its dynamic computation graph and ease of use.

#### Computer vision is revolutionizing industries by providing machines with the ability to see, interpret, and make decisions based on visual data, leading to smarter, more efficient systems.
